# API
Using HTML5 CSS3 JavaScript I created the Fetching API web application.
Firstly I created the responsive page then after I use javascript for for fatching a given api key.
using fetch function I fatched the data and store in the div element using innerHTML code.
I also use loader when the API key is wrong or status is 404 so the loader is keep rotating and it stop when the status in 200.
the button is only clicked by once so their is no fetching data is repeated.
